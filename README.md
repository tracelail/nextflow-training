# Goal
My aim is to become "expert-like" in Nextflow. I have taken a few of the trainings from [Nextflow Training 2.8.1](https://training.nextflow.io/2.8.1/)<br>
but I want to retake the early trainings and progress forwards.<br>
<br>
I will be using Claude AI to guide me on 1 hr training sessions using [Nextflow Training](https://training.nextflow.io/2.8.1/) and [Seqera Blog](https://seqera.io/blog/)<br>
with minimal other inputs.

# Day 1: Nextflow Basics

Basic Nextflow concepts with modern syntax (2026 conventions).

## Files

- `hello.nf` - Basic println
- `process-basics.nf` - Understanding processes
- `process-input.nf` - Process with input
- `channels-basic.nf` - Parallel processing with channels
- `file-process.nf` - Working with files
- `file-process-multi.nf` - Multiple files with named outputs

## Key Concepts Learned

- Processes are like functions that encapsulate tasks
- Channels enable parallel execution (like parallel for-loops)
- `stdout` captures terminal output as a channel
- Named outputs with `emit:` make code more readable
- Wildcards in `path` outputs capture dynamically created files

# Day 2: Nextflow Operators and Channels
